  ## Motivation

  Everyone has experienced the problem of having to split the bill between a group of friends. Split It intends to solve the headaches and pain of calculating the bill between a group of people without using cash to split the bill. One of the goals of Split It is to provide the user a pleasant and enjoyable experience while using our product. The user will have the option of manually assigning the name and cost of an item to each person in the group or automate the process by taking a picure of the receipt and assigning the cost of the item to each person. The User will also have the option to choose the tax and tip as part of the payment system.
